#problem: keep track of numbers already tried, so I won't try them again
#has to be recursive. I'm not so sure on recursive
#alternative: try and understand the AC3 algorithm and implement

#using standard search
#state -> values assigned so far. initial state -> []
#successor function: assign a variable
#goal test: current assignment satisfies all constraints

#let's start with the naive approach, meaning no arc-consistency
